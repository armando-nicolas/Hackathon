**💡 Objective:**

To develop an **inclusivity index for movies** that evaluates diversity representation concerning race, gender, sexual orientation ... We'll start off with **IMDB data** and **Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus**, aiming to provide insights into the inclusivity of cinema and how it reflects society.

![Inclusivity in cinema, painstakingly created after multiple iterations, cause DAL·LE is a bit racist](dalle-inclusivity-cinema.png)

**🔍 Tasks include:**

* Defining a new inclusivity index
* Recodifying characters' metadata to include race, sexual orientation ...
* Analyzing the marketability of inclusive cinema
* Applying the model to Academy Award best picture nominees
* Interactive explanatory notebook of the index results and its components
* Interactive visualization of the characters' metadata
* Visual analysis of box office revenue and inclusivity
* Visual analysis of the latest Academy Award nominees

**🧑‍🎓 What you will learn:**

- Advanced techniques in data science and visualization.
- Collaborative skills in a team setting.
- How to translate data insights into actionable visual stories.
- Understanding of inclusivity in the context of the film industry.

**📅 Pre-hackathon preparations:**

- Familiarize with IMDB data and Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus —including understanding each variables and doing any data cleanup required.
- Research inclusivity in cinema and review the [helpful tools and resources](#some-helpful-tools-and-resources). 
- Plan your particular tasks and objectives.
- Discuss in teams your roles and strategy.
- Set up communication and project management tools.
- Set up your computing environment for data analysis and visualization.

> **⚠ IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
> Collaboration is key. Ensure to coordinate with other teams as each group’s output is interconnected.

## About the data

Our primary datasets are:

- **IMDB Data Capture:** Contains comprehensive movie data, including titles, genres, release years, ratings, and more.
- **Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus:** A rich dataset featuring 220,579 conversational exchanges from 617 movies, inclusive of character metadata like gender and credit positions.

**Datasets, codebook and details** can be found here: [data](./data/) [README](./data/README.md)

## Day-of schedule

The Hackathon takes place in the P-IV building, EPS UdG on February 3, 2024.

We will provide breakfast 🥐, lunch 🥪, snacks 🍌, coffee ☕ ...

* 👋 **09:30** Welcome, reminder of logistics like working rooms, lunch, drinks, communication channels ...
* 🙋‍♀️ **09:45** Standup meeting. Objectives, processes, what you want to achieve in the hackathon and any questions.
* 👩‍💻 **10:00** Start of work day!
* 🙋‍♀️ **13:45** Short standup
* 🍱 **14:00** Lunch
* 👩‍💻 **15:00** Back to work
* 🧑‍🏫 **19:00** Wrap-up presentation < 6 slides 😜: About 5-7 minutes per team, in English.
  * What was achieved?
  * What was helpful?
  * What’s left to do?
* 🏆 **19:30** Awards
* 🥳 **20:00** End!!!

*We'll come to you, moving from group to group, and we'll be available for questions and solving blocks.*

## Collaboration recommendations

* Use folders and file names that are human-readable and let you identify the content, preferably use lower case separated by dashes. For example: `movie-characters-gender-race-orientation.json`
* Follow the Branch Per Feature model: one feature, one branch.
* Prepend each branch with your team name. For example if you're commiting part of your work cleaning up the data, you would push it to a `owls--data-cleaning` branch.
* Use a consistent pattern for commit messages, a nice one is `type of commit: description of the commit in imperative mood` as in `refactor: use map instead of for loop`.

## The awards

As we all know the [professional jury and the popular vote don't always match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uGN9efcACw), so we're offering two awards: you all decide one via an open vote, we decide the other —which may or may not be the same, and we won't know until we reveal them simultaneously. There will be an guest judge and the presentation must be in English.

**Vote here for the best team**()
* You must vote 3, 2, 1; you can't vote all 3s, or vote all 2s or vote one 3 for yourselves and the rest 1s ...
* Note to any team with more than 5 members, for the popular vote to be fair one of you mustn't vote.

🏆 Jury fav: A **€500 gift card** for the team (sponsored by the Càtedra Informació i Computació via Eurecat)

🏆 Popular vote: A copy of **Extra Bold**: A Feminist, Inclusive, Anti-racist, Nonbinary Field Guide for Graphic Designers by by Ellen Lupton, Jennifer Tobias, Josh Halstead, Leslie Xia, Kaleena Sales, Farah Kafei, and Valentina Vergara, for each team member (sponsored by ViT)
