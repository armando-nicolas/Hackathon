# EPS - M√†ster in Data Science UdG | Hackathon: Inclusivity in Cinema
This hackathon, an event between the Data Science and Data Visualization subjects, is supported by the [ViT Foundation](https://www.fundaciovit.org/), the [C√†tedra Llu√≠s Santal√≥ d'Aplicacions de la Matem√†tica](http://www.udg.edu/es/catedres/Lluis-Santalo), and the [C√†tedra d'Informaci√≥ i Computaci√≥ (Eurecat)](https://www.udg.edu/ca/catedres/informacio-i-computacio).

**üí° Objective:**

To develop an **inclusivity index for movies** that evaluates diversity representation concerning race, gender, and sexual orientation. We'll utilize **IMDB data** and **Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus**, aiming to provide insights into the inclusivity of cinema and how it reflects society.

**üîç Tasks include:**

1. **Defining a New Inclusivity Test (Data Science Task)**
2. **Interactive Explanatory Notebook of Index Results and Weights (Data Visualization Task)**
3. **Recodifying Characters' Metadata (Data Science Task)**
4. **Interactive Visualization of Metadata (Data Visualization Task)**
5. **Analyzing the Marketability of Inclusive Cinema (Data Science Task)**
6. **Visual Analysis of Box Office Revenue and Inclusivity (Data Visualization Task)**
7. **Applying the Model to Academy Award Best Picture Nominees (Data Science Task)**
8. **Visual Analysis of Main Takeaways (Data Visualization Task)**

**üßë‚Äçüéì What you will learn:**

- Advanced techniques in data science and visualization.
- Collaborative skills in a team setting.
- How to translate data insights into actionable visual stories.
- Understanding of inclusivity in the context of the film industry.

**üìÖ Pre-hackathon preparations:**

- Familiarize with IMDB data and Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus.
- Team meetings to discuss roles and strategy.
- Establish communication and project management tools.
- Prepare your computing environment for data analysis and visualization.

> **‚ö† IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
> Collaboration is key. Ensure to coordinate with other teams as each group‚Äôs output is interconnected.

# About the data

Our primary datasets are:

- **IMDB Data Capture:** Contains comprehensive movie data, including titles, genres, release years, ratings, and more.
- **Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus:** A rich dataset featuring 220,579 conversational exchanges from 617 movies, inclusive of character metadata like gender and credit positions.
