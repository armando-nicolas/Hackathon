# EPS - Màster in Data Science UdG | Hackathon: Inclusivity in Cinema
This hackathon, an event between the Data Science and Data Visualization subjects, is supported by the [ViT Foundation](https://www.fundaciovit.org/), the [Càtedra Lluís Santaló d'Aplicacions de la Matemàtica](http://www.udg.edu/es/catedres/Lluis-Santalo), and the [Càtedra d'Informació i Computació (Eurecat)](https://www.udg.edu/ca/catedres/informacio-i-computacio).

**💡 Objective:**

To develop an **inclusivity index for movies** that evaluates diversity representation concerning race, gender, and sexual orientation. We'll utilize **IMDB data** and **Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus**, aiming to provide insights into the inclusivity of cinema and how it reflects society.

**🔍 Tasks include:**

1. **Defining a New Inclusivity Test (Data Science Task)**
2. **Interactive Explanatory Notebook of Index Results and Weights (Data Visualization Task)**
3. **Recodifying Characters' Metadata (Data Science Task)**
4. **Interactive Visualization of Metadata (Data Visualization Task)**
5. **Analyzing the Marketability of Inclusive Cinema (Data Science Task)**
6. **Visual Analysis of Box Office Revenue and Inclusivity (Data Visualization Task)**
7. **Applying the Model to Academy Award Best Picture Nominees (Data Science Task)**
8. **Visual Analysis of Main Takeaways (Data Visualization Task)**

**🧑‍🎓 What you will learn:**

- Advanced techniques in data science and visualization.
- Collaborative skills in a team setting.
- How to translate data insights into actionable visual stories.
- Understanding of inclusivity in the context of the film industry.

**📅 Pre-hackathon preparations:**

- Familiarize with IMDB data and Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus.
- Team meetings to discuss roles and strategy.
- Establish communication and project management tools.
- Prepare your computing environment for data analysis and visualization.

> **⚠ IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
> Collaboration is key. Ensure to coordinate with other teams as each group’s output is interconnected.

# About the data

Our primary datasets are:

- **IMDB Data Capture:** Contains comprehensive movie data, including titles, genres, release years, ratings, and more.
- **Cornell's Movie Dialog Corpus:** A rich dataset featuring 220,579 conversational exchanges from 617 movies, inclusive of character metadata like gender and credit positions.

**Datasets, codebook and details** can be found here: [data](./data/) [README](./data/README.md)

## Day-of schedule

The Hackathon takes place in the P-IV building, EPS UdG on February 3, 2024.

We will provide breakfast 🥐, lunch 🥪, snacks 🍌, coffee ☕ ...

* 👋 **09:30** Welcome, reminder of logistics like working rooms, lunch, drinks, communication channels ...
* 🙋‍♀️ **09:45** Standup meeting. Objectives, processes, what you want to achieve in the hackathon and any questions.
* 👩‍💻 **10:00** Start of work day!
* 🙋‍♀️ **13:45** Short standup
* 🍱 **14:00** Lunch
* 👩‍💻 **15:00** Back to work
* 🧑‍🏫 **19:00** Wrap-up presentation < 6 slides 😜: About 5-7 minutes per team, in English.
  * What was achieved?
  * What was helpful?
  * What’s left to do?
* 🏆 **19:30** Awards
* 🥳 **20:00** End!!!

*We'll come to you, moving from group to group, and we'll be available for questions and solving blocks.*

## Collaboration recommendations

* Use folders and file names that are human-readable and let you identify the content, preferably use lower case separated by dashes. For example: `movie-characters-gender-race-orientation.json`
* Follow the Branch Per Feature model: one feature, one branch.
* Prepend each branch with your team name. For example if you're commiting part of your work cleaning up the data, you would push it to a `owls--data-cleaning` branch.
* Use a consistent pattern for commit messages, a nice one is `type of commit: description of the commit in imperative mood` as in `refactor: use map instead of for loop`.

## The awards

As we all know the [professional jury and the popular vote don't always match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uGN9efcACw), so we're offering two awards: you all decide one via an open vote, we decide the other —which may or may not be the same, and we won't know until we reveal them simultaneously. There will be an guest judge and the presentation must be in English.

[**Vote here for the best team**]()
* You must vote 3, 2, 1; you can't vote all 3s, or vote all 2s or vote one 3 for yourselves and the rest 1s ...
* Pandas, to be fair, one of you mustn't vote.

🏆 Jury fav: A **€500 gift card** for the team (sponsored by the Càtedra Informació i Computació via Eurecat)

🏆 Popular vote: A copy of **Extra Bold**: A Feminist, Inclusive, Anti-racist, Nonbinary Field Guide for Graphic Designers by by Ellen Lupton, Jennifer Tobias, Josh Halstead, Leslie Xia, Kaleena Sales, Farah Kafei, and Valentina Vergara, for each team member (sponsored by ViT)

## Our evaluation criteria

### For the **Project Management** subject:

TK TK 

Self and peer evaluation forms:
TK TK 

### For the **Information Visualization** subject:

* All attending students get 0.25 for actively participating.
* All students in the winning groups get 0.5 (if the popular vote coincides with the jury favorite they'll get an extra 0.25)
* We will take into account:
  * How clearly the visualization displays the results,
  * the strategies used to highlight patterns,
  * the integration of the visuals with the documentation or the text in the notebook.

Remember that the hackathon will account for [**10% of the final mark for the subject**](https://observablehq.com/d/7d86ca84216262ac?collection=@udg-master-data-science/information-visualization#cell-212)—i.e. one full point.
